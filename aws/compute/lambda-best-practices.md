## Architecture Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Use AWS EventBridge for complex event routing
- Implement dead-letter queues (DLQ) for failed event processing
- Design stateless functions for better scalability

### Microservices Design
- Keep functions focused on single responsibility
- Use API Gateway for RESTful interfaces
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls

### Data Flow Patterns
- Use Step Functions for complex workflows
- Implement fan-out pattern using SNS/SQS
- Consider event sourcing for audit requirements

## Performance Optimization

### Cold Start Mitigation
1. Code Optimization
   - Minimize deployment package size
   - Use layer for dependencies
   - Implement lazy loading

2. Memory Configuration
   - Choose appropriate memory settings
   - Use Power Tuning tool for optimization
   - Consider cost-performance trade-offs

3. Execution Environment
   - Use Provisioned Concurrency for critical paths
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Cache external service responses

### Code Efficiency
- Initialize SDK clients outside handler
- Use async/await for better performance
- Implement proper error handling

## Security Best Practices

### IAM and Permissions
1. Role Configuration
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Use separate roles for different functions
   - Regularly audit permissions

2. Secrets Management
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Encrypt sensitive data

### Network Security
- Configure VPC when necessary
- Implement proper security groups
- Use AWS WAF with API Gateway

### Input Validation
- Validate all input parameters
- Implement request throttling
- Use API Gateway request validation

## Monitoring and Observability

### CloudWatch Integration
1. Metrics
   - Monitor invocation metrics
   - Track error rates
   - Set up custom metrics

2. Logging
   - Implement structured logging
   - Use log levels appropriately
   - Configure log retention

### X-Ray Tracing
- Enable active tracing
- Add subsegments for external calls
- Monitor service dependencies

### Alerts and Notifications
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms
- Configure SNS notifications
- Implement proper error reporting

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Configuration
1. Memory Allocation
   - Right-size memory settings
   - Use Power Tuning for optimization
   - Monitor memory usage

2. Timeout Settings
   - Set appropriate timeouts
   - Handle long-running processes
   - Use Step Functions for orchestration

### Code Optimization
- Minimize external service calls
- Implement caching strategies
- Use batch processing when possible

### Pricing Optimization
- Use Reserved Concurrency
- Implement request throttling
- Monitor and optimize costs

## Development and Deployment

### Local Development
1. Tools and Frameworks
   - Use AWS SAM for local testing
   - Implement unit tests
   - Use mock services

2. CI/CD Pipeline
   - Automate deployments
   - Implement environment stages
   - Use infrastructure as code

### Version Control
- Use proper versioning strategy
- Implement aliases
- Maintain deployment history

### Testing Strategies
1. Unit Testing
   - Test business logic
   - Mock AWS services
   - Implement test coverage

2. Integration Testing
   - Test API endpoints
   - Verify event processing
   - Test error scenarios

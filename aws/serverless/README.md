# AWS Serverless Services

## AWS Lambda

### Core Concepts
- Functions and execution environment
- Runtime support and custom runtimes
- Event sources and triggers
- Concurrency and scaling
- Cold starts and provisioned concurrency

### Function Configuration
- Memory and timeout settings
- Environment variables
- IAM roles and permissions
- VPC configuration
- Layer management

### Integration Points
- API Gateway
- EventBridge
- S3 events
- DynamoDB Streams
- SQS/SNS triggers

## API Gateway

### Features
- REST and HTTP APIs
- WebSocket APIs
- Request/response transformations
- Authentication and authorization
- API keys and usage plans

### Deployment Options
- Stages and environments
- Canary deployments
- Custom domain names
- Regional vs Edge-optimized

## Event-Driven Architecture

### SQS (Simple Queue Service)
- Standard vs FIFO queues
- Message attributes
- Dead-letter queues
- Long polling

### SNS (Simple Notification Service)
- Topics and subscriptions
- Message filtering
- Message attributes
- Delivery protocols

## Hands-on Projects
1. Build a serverless REST API
2. Create event-driven processing pipelines
3. Implement asynchronous workflows
4. Set up pub/sub messaging patterns

## Best Practices
- Function design patterns
- Error handling and retries
- Monitoring and observability
- Cost optimization
- Security best practices
- Performance tuning

- Container image requirements

### Step 3: Hands-on with Fargate
1. Setting up your first Fargate cluster
   - Create an ECS cluster
   - Configure networking (VPC, subnets)
   - Set up IAM roles

2. Deploying containers
   - Create task definitions
   - Configure container settings
   - Deploy services

3. Advanced configurations
   - Implement auto scaling
   - Set up load balancing
   - Configure service discovery
   - Implement logging and monitoring

# AWS Cloud Platform Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning journey with Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the leading cloud computing platforms. Here, I'll track my progress, document key concepts, and store practical examples of working with various AWS services.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand core AWS concepts and services
- Gain hands-on experience with AWS cloud infrastructure
- Learn best practices for cloud architecture
- Develop skills in cloud deployment and management
- Prepare for AWS certifications

- Lambda (Serverless Computing)
- ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

### Storage
- S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- EFS (Elastic File System)

### Database
- RDS (Relational Database Service)
- DynamoDB (NoSQL Database)
- Aurora (MySQL/PostgreSQL-compatible)

### Networking
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Route 53 (DNS Service)

## Getting Started

1. Set up an AWS Account
   - Create a free tier AWS account
   - Set up IAM users and security credentials
   - Install AWS CLI

2. Configure AWS CLI
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. Start exploring services
   - Begin with basic services like S3 and EC2
   - Progress to more complex architectures
   - Document learnings and code examples in this repository

## Best Practices

- Always follow AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) when possible
- Implement proper security measures
- Monitor costs and use AWS Cost Explorer
- Regular backups and disaster recovery planning
